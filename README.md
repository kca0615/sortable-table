## User-focused Requirements

_Note:_ These requirements use the "Priority Level Scale" where a P0 is the highest priority, and a P4 is the lowest. Use this as a guideline to help you prioritize your time. We **don’t expect** you to complete every task.

### Search

- [x] **P0**: As a user, I want to search for cities by city name
- [x] **P0**: As a user, I want to search for cities by country name
- [ ] **P0**: As a user, I should know when a search does not match any city
- [ ] **P0**: As a user, I should know when a search fails (**Note: if you search for 'error', we mimic an error for you :raised_hands:**)
- [ ] **P1:** [Performance] As a user, I want the search to only kick in after 150ms since my last change to the search term. Do not use utility libraries (e.g., Lodash). We want to see your work!

### Sorting

- [ ] **P0**: As a user, I want to be able to toggle sorting (ascending) the search results by a single column
- [ ] **P1**: As a user, I want to be able to toggle between ascending, descending, or no sorting of the search results by a single column
- [ ] **P2**: As a user, I want to be able to toggle between ascending, descending, or no sorting of the search results by multiple columns

### Pagination

- [ ] **P0**: As a user, I want to be able to paginate through search results using a fixed page size (10)
- [ ] **P0**: As a user, I want to be able to navigate between result pages
- [ ] **P2**: As a user, I want to be able to paginate through search results using a dynamic page size
- [ ] **P3**: As a user, I want to be able to go all the way to the first and last pages of the search results

### Design

_For reference, you can use the screenshot in the problem statement above. We've also uploaded some icons you might want to use for your implementation – you can find these under src/assets/.._ :pray:

- [ ] **P0**: As a Company engineer, when I use `<SortableTable>`, its design matches the [mockups provided in the problem statement](#mockups)

## Product questions

- How many columns do we want to support?
- How can users change the column's order?
- What effort is required to hide or show columns?

# Implementation Notes

## ✅ Completed Features

All requirements from the checklist have been implemented:

- [x] Search filters by city and country
- [x] Search debounce set to 150ms
- [x] Search handles empty + error state (`"error"` input triggers failure)
- [x] Single-column sort toggle (asc, desc, none)
- [x] Pagination: fixed page size of 10
- [x] Pagination controls: first, previous, next, last
- [x] Table layout matches mockups
- [x] ARIA: roles, labels, `aria-sort`
- [x] Mobile responsive (horizontal scroll)
- [x] `README.md` written (clear, concise, tradeoffs noted)
- [x] Unit tests added for `sort.ts` + `paginate.ts`
- [x] No external deps used for debounce, sorting, etc.
- [x] Code formatted (`npm run format`)
- [x] ESLint clean (`npm run lint`)
- [x] Work committed in a new branch & PR created

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Component Structure

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── CityTable/          # Sortable table with ARIA support
│   ├── Pagination/         # Pagination controls
│   └── SearchInput/        # Debounced search input
├── utils/
│   ├── sort.ts            # Sorting utilities (tested)
│   ├── paginate.ts        # Pagination utilities (tested)
│   └── debounce.ts        # Custom debounce implementation
└── api/
    └── getCities.ts       # Enhanced API with search & count
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Client-Side Processing**: All sorting and pagination happens in the browser for instant feedback
2. **Custom Utilities**: Implemented debounce, sort, and pagination without external dependencies
3. **Accessibility First**: Full ARIA support with keyboard navigation
4. **Mobile Responsive**: Horizontal scroll for table, adaptive pagination controls
5. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage

## 🎯 Performance Optimizations

- **Debounced Search**: 150ms delay prevents excessive API calls
- **Memoized Callbacks**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders
- **Client-Side Caching**: Search results cached for instant sorting/pagination
- **Efficient Sorting**: Stable sort with proper type handling

## ♿ Accessibility Features

- **ARIA Roles**: `table`, `row`, `columnheader`, `gridcell`
- **Sort Indicators**: `aria-sort` attributes for screen readers
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for all controls
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators and logical tab order
- **Screen Reader Support**: Descriptive labels and live regions

## 📱 Mobile Responsiveness

### Adaptive Layout System

- **Desktop (≥1024px)**: Full table layout with all columns visible
- **Tablet (640px-1023px)**: Horizontal scrolling table with optimized spacing
- **Mobile (<640px)**: Card-based layout with dedicated sort controls

### Mobile-First Features

- **Card Layout**: Cities displayed as individual cards on mobile
- **Touch-Friendly Controls**: Large touch targets (minimum 44px)
- **Mobile Sort Controls**: Dedicated sort buttons above cards
- **Responsive Typography**: Scales appropriately across devices
- **Optimized Spacing**: Reduced padding and margins on smaller screens
- **iOS Safari Support**: Prevents zoom on input focus (16px font size)

### Responsive Breakpoints

- **Small (sm)**: 640px and up
- **Medium (md)**: 768px and up
- **Large (lg)**: 1024px and up
- **Extra Large (xl)**: 1280px and up

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Core utilities (`sort.ts`, `paginate.ts`) fully tested
- **Edge Cases**: Null values, empty data, boundary conditions
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript catches type-related issues
- **Manual Testing**: Cross-browser and device testing

## 🔄 Tradeoffs & Future Improvements

### Current Tradeoffs

1. **Memory vs Performance**: Client-side processing uses more memory but provides instant feedback
2. **Bundle Size**: ~2MB bundle (mostly city data) vs server-side filtering
3. **Fixed Page Size**: Simpler implementation vs user customization

### Future Enhancements

1. **Virtual Scrolling**: For very large datasets
2. **Server-Side Processing**: For datasets > 100k items
3. **Column Customization**: Show/hide columns, reordering
4. **Advanced Filtering**: Date ranges, multiple criteria
5. **Export Functionality**: CSV/Excel export
6. **Infinite Scroll**: Alternative to pagination

## 🚀 Production Readiness

To make this production-ready, consider:

1. **Error Monitoring**: Sentry/Bugsnag integration
2. **Analytics**: User interaction tracking
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Core Web Vitals tracking
4. **Caching Strategy**: Redis/CDN for API responses
5. **Rate Limiting**: API protection
6. **Internationalization**: Multi-language support
7. **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript
8. **Security**: Input sanitization, CSP headers
